# Ansible role to deploy Framadate server docker

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/licence-AGPL--3-blue.svg)](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl "License: AGPL-3")

This role allows you to deploy Framadate docker with associated MariaDB and either real postfix relay or mailhog to capture sent e-mails.

This role is based on [Le Filament Framadate Docker](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/lefilament/framadate) which is also described on corresponding [Le Filament GitHub page](https://github.com/lefilament/docker_framadate), and is collecting code directly from [Framasoft Framapad git repository](https://framagit.org/framasoft/framadate/framadate).

This role also embeds automatic backups towards swift storage every day (with one full backup every week and retention of 3 full backups) using duplicity based on [Tecnativa docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/tecnativa/duplicity). See [Ansible docker Nextcloud role](https://github.com/lefilament/ansible_role_nextcloud_docker/blob/master/files/Dockerfile-backup) for building that docker image.

Prior to running this role, you would need to have docker installed on your server and a traefik proxy (which is the purpose of [this role](https://github.com/lefilament/ansible_role_docker_server))

In order to use this role, you would need to define the following variables for your server (in hostvars for instance) - Only the names of the variables are provided below (not the values) for these used by this role to properly configure everything, you may copy this file directly in hostvars and set the variable although we could only encourage you to use an Ansible vault and refer vault variables from there:

```json
